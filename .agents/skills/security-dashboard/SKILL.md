name: security-dashboard
description: Use to launch the guardrail SOC dashboard — a live view of every guardrail decision (BLOCK/WARN/ALLOW), threat-category breakdown, and the actual command evaluated for each event. Invoke when the user wants to see, monitor, or demo guardrail activity.

# Security Dashboard

## When invoked
`$HARNESS` = `.agents/scripts` in this repo, else `~/.copilot/harness` (global). Windows global: `$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\harness`.
1. Repo: `npm run dashboard`. Global: `node "$HARNESS/dashboard/serve.js"` (serves dashboard + opens browser).
2. Defaults to http://localhost:8765 — override with `PORT=9000`.
3. Reads the live `guardrail.log` from `logs/` (repo) or `~/.copilot/logs/` (global), so it reflects real decisions, not samples.

## What it shows
- KST timestamps, totals (BLOCK / WARN / ALLOW), cumulative-block trend, decision donut.
- Recent runs table — hover any row to see `severity · reason · evaluated command`.
- Threat-category bars mapped to `CONTEXT.md`.

## Generate activity
No log yet? Run a few commands through the hook (`node "$HARNESS/pre-tool-use.js"`), or load any `.log` via the file picker.
