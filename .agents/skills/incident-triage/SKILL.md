# Incident Triage

1. Read `guardrail.log` from `logs/` (repo) or `~/.copilot/logs/` (global); group by category and time.
2. Reconstruct what was attempted, which agent/tool, and whether it was blocked.
3. Assess blast radius: what data/systems were reachable.
4. Korean report: 타임라인 · 분류 · 영향범위 · 권고 (rotate/contain/rule-update). Verdict on residual risk.
